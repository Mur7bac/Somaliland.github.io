                <h2> Early years</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 6%;"> Mohamoud was born in 1936 in the mideastern town of Burco, situated in what was then the former British Somaliland protectorate. Nicknamed "Silanyo", he hails from the Habar-Jeclo clan of the Isaaq. Ahmed M. Mohamoud Silanyo is the third child of four. His father was a merchant marine, so the family lived a half-nomadic, half-settled lifestyle. He was the only child in the family to attend a formal education, fostered by an uncle who was a strong influence on his early life. His brothers followed their father’s footsteps as merchant marines. He is Muslim.</p>

                <p>>He met his wife, Amina-Weris Sh. Mohamed, in the late 1960s. Like him, she completed her education as a registered nurse and midwife in England. She is one of the pioneers of the Somali’s educated women. They married in Mogadishu in 1968. She has been a strong partner, by his side throughout the long and turbulent times of his political career. They have five children (Lul, Hodan, Kulmiye, Ali-Salan, and Rashid) and four grandchildren (Idil, Ahmed-Zaki, Safia, and Riad.)</p>
                <p>Between 1946 and 1957, Mohamoud studied at schools in Sheekh and Amud, where he completed his secondary levels</p>

            <p>Upon graduation, he moved to England to pursue higher studies. From 1958 to 1960, Mohamoud enrolled in London University and obtained an advanced General Certificate of Education (GCE). He then studied at University of Manchester, where he earned both a Bachelor's Degree (1960–63) and a Master's Degree (1960–63) in Economics.[1][6]</p>

        <h2> Career</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 6%;"> In a professional capacity, between 1965 and 1969, Mohamoud served as an official at the Ministry of Planning and Coordination in Mogadishu during Somalia's early civilian administration. He was also the national Minister of Planning and Coordination (1969–1973), Minister of Commerce (1973–1978 and 1980–1982), and the Chairman of the National Economic Board (1978–1980) in the succeeding socialist government.</p>


             <p>Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud "Silanyo"
            From 1982 to 1990, Mohamoud was the Chairman of the Somali National Movement (SNM), serving as the liberation group's longest-serving chairman.[4] In March 1991, he proposed a power-sharing framework between the SNM and the Mogadishu-based United Somali Congress (USC) under a new transitional national government, but the USC unilaterally established a government of its own in Mogadishu, thus cutting the reestablishment of Somaliland and Somalia Union.[8]</p>

             <p>Between 1993 to 1997, Mohamoud was a member of the House of Representatives of Somaliland. He also worked as the Somaliland Minister of Finance from 1997 to 1999, in which position he initiated a program of fiscal reform. Between 1999 and 2000, Mohamoud served as Somaliland's Minister of Planning and Coordination, a position from which he resigned in 2001.</p>

Regions and districts in Somaliland are not just an instrument for the organisation of local government, they are also used as electoral districts. Kahin's move was considered by several to have motives rooted in electoral and clan-politics. Moreover, as these new regions and districts were never geographically delimitated, they argued that he saddled the region with a legacy that hampers the efficient organisation of local government to this day.</p>

            <h2>President of Somaliland</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">n 3 May 2002, Kahin became the third President of Somaliland, after the death of the autonomous region's President Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal. Kahin later won the elections on 14 April 2003, representing the Ururka Dimuqraadiga Umada Bahawday (UDUB), or United Democratic People's Party. He was sworn into office on 16 May.</p>

            <p>In 2008, Kahin established by decree new regions and districts, which drew criticism. Regions and districts in Somaliland are not just an instrument for the organisation of local government, they are also used as electoral districts. Kahin's move was considered by several to have motives rooted in electoral and clan-politics. Moreover, as these new regions and districts were never geographically delimitated, they argued that he saddled the region with a legacy that hampers the efficient organisation of local government to this day.</p>

            <p>Throughout his tenure as President of Somaliland, Kahim sought to maintain peace and tranquility in the region. His administration contributed to various state-building and institutional development initiatives. In terms of democratization, his government also successfully organized local council elections, parliamentary elections, and two presidential elections. Additionally, Kahin is noted for having peacefully transferred power to his successor in office, President Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud.
