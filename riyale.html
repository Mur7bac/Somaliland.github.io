                <h2> Early years</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 6%;"> Kahin was born in the town of Quljeed, situated in the northwestern Awdal region of British Somaliland. He was educated in Amoud, and was later trained in Mogadishu.
                </p>
                <p> Kahin's previous posts included a diplomatic position at the Somali Embassy in Djibouti.

                    In the last years of the Siad Barre government, during the 1980s, Kahin was the highest-ranking National Security Service (NSS) officer in Berbera.[1]

                    From 1997 to 2002, Kahin served as the Vice President of Somaliland, an autonomous region in Somalia.</p>

        <h2> Career</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 6%;"> Kaahin initially worked as an unofficial member of the former British Somaliland protectorate's Executive Council, and was the Leader of Government Business in the Legislative Council. For five days in June 1960, he served as the Prime Minister of the briefly-extant State of Somaliland (the former British Somaliland) during its planned transition to union with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.</p>

         <p>Following Somalia's independence on July 1, 1960, Egal became the first national Minister of Defense (1960-1962). In 1962, he left the government to form the opposition Somali National Congress. Two years later he joined the Somali Youth League, the majority party in the government at that point. In 1967, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was elected President and he appointed Egal as the Prime Minister.</p>
        <p> He was still the Prime Minister and in Washington D.C. when President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated on October 15, 1969. Shortly afterward, the newly established Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) led by Major General Siad Barre, Brigadier General Mohamed Ainashe Gule, Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel seized power.</p>
        <p>The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former civilian government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution. Egal was among the politicians detained by the SRC for his prominent role in the nation's early government. He was eventually released and was named the Ambassador to India (1976-1978) before the Barre regime imprisoned him again on charges of conspiracy until 1985.</p>

        <p>When the Barre regime eventually collapsed in 1991 with the start of the civil war, local leaders in north Somalia declared the region independent. Although Egal initially opposed their self-proclaimed secession, he was elected president of the new Somaliland polity two years later by a regional council of elders.</p>

            <h2>President of Somaliland</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">n 3 May 2002, Kahin became the third President of Somaliland, after the death of the autonomous region's President Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal. Kahin later won the elections on 14 April 2003, representing the Ururka Dimuqraadiga Umada Bahawday (UDUB), or United Democratic People's Party. He was sworn into office on 16 May.</p>

            <p>In 2008, Kahin established by decree new regions and districts, which drew criticism. Regions and districts in Somaliland are not just an instrument for the organisation of local government, they are also used as electoral districts. Kahin's move was considered by several to have motives rooted in electoral and clan-politics. Moreover, as these new regions and districts were never geographically delimitated, they argued that he saddled the region with a legacy that hampers the efficient organisation of local government to this day.</p>

            <p>Throughout his tenure as President of Somaliland, Kahim sought to maintain peace and tranquility in the region. His administration contributed to various state-building and institutional development initiatives. In terms of democratization, his government also successfully organized local council elections, parliamentary elections, and two presidential elections. Additionally, Kahin is noted for having peacefully transferred power to his successor in office, President Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud.
